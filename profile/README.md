Welcome to the online home for *Introductory Geospatial Analysis*. This course offers a comprehensive introduction to the theory and practice of Geographic Information Systems (GIS) and geospatial analysis, equipping students with essential skills for solving fundamental geospatial problems.

At the core of this course are hands-on practical exercises built around the **R statistical language**, enabling students to develop and apply key geo-analytical skills. Using a problem-based learning approach, students will work both individually and collaboratively to tackle real-world geospatial challenges with open-source tools and technologies.
